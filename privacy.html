            What are cookies and how do we use them? Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. This data is usually a string of numbers and letters that uniquely
            identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honour your preferences and settings, enable you to
            sign-in, combat fraud, analyse how our products perform and fulfil other legitimate purposes described below.
        </p>

            We will use cookies often for these reasons:

                <li>- Performance.

            We also use “web beacons” to help deliver cookies and gather usage and performance data. Our websites may include web beacons, cookies or similar technologies from third-party service providers.<br>
            You have a variety of tools to control the data collected by cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. For example, you can use controls in your internet browser to limit how the websites you visit are able to use cookies and to withdraw
            your consent by clearing or blocking cookies.
        </p>
        <i>
            What if I don’t want to use cookies?
        </i>
        <p>
            Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. For example, in Microsoft Edge, you can block or delete cookies by selecting Settings > Privacy and services > Clear Browsing data > Cookies
            and other site data. For more information about how to delete your cookies refer to that browser’s instructions.

            What else do we use?
        </i>
        <p>
            In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our products can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing
            certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, these technologies can also store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then track behaviour. <i>Any Personally Identifiable Information is destroyed and stored which is unaccessable to developers.
